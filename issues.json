I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\n\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇 For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\n\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely. It may be more suitable to find an alternative to fill that space and act as the one-line pitch. If anyone has suggestions, please feel free to add them!\n\nSome follow-up discussions can be found on that PR.

and FileProxy fixes","body":"fbe8452 introduced FileDict, as a subclass of dict.\nIt contains many unnecessary methods which needlessly override the dict method.  The override methods mostly just call the super() method, creating an extra performance degradation.\nThe only method which isnt just super() is __getitem__.  It contains a bug, because if the value in the dict has 0 lines, val is [] , and if val: will be false, and None is returned instead of [].  That is wildly different behaviour to previously, as None is not iterable.  It means all code (including global bears) needs to check whether the file is None before iterating over the file contents.  File contents being None was previously possible, but only when 'raw' mode was enabled.  A file with 0 lines is not the same as an unreadable / raw file.\nFileFactory was introduced in b06dfe4.  The most critical problem is that it is not a \"factory\".  Factories are an extremely important and very well established pattern covered in all OO books with buying ( https://www.oodesign.com/factory-pattern.html ), so to call this a factory is very confusing / misleading.\nIt was to be a wrapper for a \"file\" object, which was previously a list of str, where each item was a line of the file.  While a design goal was to hide some of the details, it still needs to be backwards compatible in order to avoid breaking existing code.  This is especially important at the moment given that the current status of coala is so bug ridden with many regressions that investigating bugs requires installing from old git commits more than a year to verify the old behaviour.\nTwo \"list\" unimplemented methods which were used by coala-quickstart are __len__ and __getitem__.  These missing methods need to be re-implemented.  If there is a good justification for deprecating them, that deprecation should be done properly.  For __len__, it seems unjustifiable to not provide this, as this single number can be cached and provides a lot of information, and is especially helpful if avoiding re-reading files which have been evicted from the cache, as a 0 line file can be more efficiently created in memory than re-reading from the disk.  __getitem__ is much easier to justify deprecating if the file contents are being evicted from the cache to reduce the memory footprint of coala.  That hasnt been implemented yet.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-10-13T18:57:47Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-17T11:22:38Z","closedAt":"2018-10-17T11:22:38Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1541054794000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5812","number":5812,"title":"LocalBearTestHelper:

You can only see the line numbers, open your editor, navigate to those lines, and check up if the position is correct and doesn't produce invalid JSON.\nThis is not acceptable and coala has to print better diffs here showing a few context lines like git does.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2018-05-24T15:28:55Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-03T15:10:41Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"Dhiraj240","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/29758643?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/actions","color":"207de5"},{"name":"difficulty/medium","color":"0052cc"},{"name":"importance/high","color":"eb6420"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1528797055000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5481","number":5481,"title":"Fail when a File isn't found or when a bear declared doesn't exist","body":"I think coala should fail when a file isn't found or when a blob results in no files and when bear declared doesn't actually exist.\nBy making it into a warning, It could accidentally mistaken to be a \"success\" when it should actually fail.

things like (12,34,56) when it's an int.\nBut yes we have indent_type which has (space, tab) in suggested_values and (\", \\') in preferred_quotes, these might be useful. So basically suggested_values are useful in cases when it lists us the allowed options only. Suggested values in tastes like indent_type and preferred_quotes and other such cases can be changed to allowed_values while the suggested_values can be removed from all other tastes.

I've raised https://gitlab.com/coala/coala-utils/issues/64 about fixing that.\nMany languages have a concept of balanced string delimiters, where the delimiter is not the first unescaped end: instead it is the matching unescaped end.  A stack is required to handle this, and coala_utils's StringProcessing doesnt support this yet.\nFor a simple example, the curly braces in Tcl are nested string delimiters.\nRuby has % string literals which are the same concept with a leading token.\nThe existing coala language definition property string_delimiters can not be re-used as-is to describe these balanced string delimiters, and we couldnt possibly use it at the moment as StringProcessing doesnt support this anyway.\nHowever it is worthwhile investigating how we might describe balanced/nested string delimiters, before attempting to implement them.\nWe might be able to re-use string_delimiters if we infer that any start, end which is also in encapsulators is a nested/balanced string delimiter.\nThat provides a way to support Tcl's {..}, but doesnt support Ruby's approach.\nMore analysis needed.\nQuite possibly a few additional language properties will be needed to be able to correctly describe balanced string delimiters for the major languages.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-06-27T13:44:41Z","updatedAt":"2018-06-27T13:44:41Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/languages","color":"d4c5f9"},{"name":"type/feature","color":"0052cc"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1535813523000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5574","number":5574,"title":"Create 'unsupported' language definitions for languages which do not use `\\` as escape sequence","body":"https://gitlab.com/coala/coala-utils/issues/64 shows that escape char \\ is hard-wired into many functions and can not be easily removed.\nTo prevent bugs, we need coalang files for languages which do not use \\ as the escape character, and those files need to clearly indicate that the language is not supported, with a comment explaining why.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-06-27T13:59:23Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-01T14:52:03Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"pareksha","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/32385407?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/languages","color":"d4c5f9"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1531136347000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5578","number":5578,"title":"Create Visual Basic language file","body":"Visual Basic has some interesting language components for strings and quotes.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-06-28T11:40:20Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-09T11:39:07Z","closedAt":"2018-07-09T11:39:07Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"pareksha","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/32385407?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/languages","color":"d4c5f9"},{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"},{"name":"importance/low","color":"70E870"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1530479602000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5579","number":5579,"title":"AttributeError: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'add_done_callback' on Python 3.7-dev","body":"NextGen scheduler is failing on Python 3.7 (dev):\n                for future in futures:\n>                   future.add_done_callback(functools.partial(\n                        self._finish_task, bear))\nE                   AttributeError: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'add_done_callback'\nhttps://travis-ci.org/jayvdb/coala/jobs/397832084","comments":6,"createdAt":"2018-06-28T14:47:48Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-01T21:13:22Z","closedAt":"2018-06-30T15:44:36Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/tests","color":"bfd4f2"},{"name":"importance/high","color":"eb6420"},{"name":"type/bug","color":"e11d21"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1530248220000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5580","number":5580,"title":"Support Tcl `comment_delimiters`","body":"In Tcl, #

When exiting the run, the Session checks if exceptions were placed into self.silent_errors/self.recovered_errors, constructs an Exceptions instance with all of those errors and raises it in the main thread.\nAcceptance criteria:\n\nAn exception is implemented that is capable of storing multiple exceptions and emitting an appropriate error message\ncore.run() raises this exception if at least one bear or result-callback failed.

This breaks things like the Emacs Flycheck integration, which runs coala not always in the directory where the .coafile exists.\n1:\nrubocop_config = .rubocop.yml\nI'm not sure if this is something that can be fixed, or how to do it. Is there someway to specifying a path in the .coafile as relative to the .coafile itself, or can the RuboCopBear determine the correct path at runtime, ...

This doesn't count for \"cache\" values, i.e. imagine you want to speed up repeated calls to the \"abs()\" function of a complex number, you have created a \"_abs_cache\" field which is initially None. Changing it shall not change the hash value, as it's not an \"instance identifying value\". If that is not avoidable, it shall be possible to override hashing behaviour in classes.)\nIt's not volatile across different Python runs (see for example hash randomization in Python for certain types).\n\nThere is a major problem though:\n\nThe hash function that attr generates utilizes repr.

documentation: adding links to the homepage and user's guide","body":"I want to propose adding the links leading to the coala homepage and the coala 'For users' guides in the navigation panel of the Coala API Documentation.\nI propose this because it will make it easier to look up other information when the users are only on the API documentation page. This is mainly for the sake of new developers for reasons I will explain below. As to my knowledge, currently there isn't a way to go from the newcomer's guide to the other places directly. In my experience, I often need to look up information on the homepage or user's guide when I am completing the tasks for the new developers. For example, in step 0 -  Run Coala, I imagine many new developers would need to install Coala. Besides, new developers might want to familiarize themselves with the usage of Coala. And now if I only have the API doc page open, I would have to either google to find the other pages (or retrieve from bookmarks).\nAt the top of the newcomer's guide, there is already a line saying \"you might also want to look at our website\" with a link of the coala homepage. But I found that it feels more natural to go to the navigation panel and look for a link when you want to jump to a different page.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2017-12-02T01:40:23Z","updatedAt":"2017-12-13T22:22:40Z","closedAt":"2017-12-13T22:22:40Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"zhongLxyz","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/25083417?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"zhongLxyz","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/25083417?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"vddesai1871","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/24962153?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1515423640000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/4939","number":4939,"title":"linter: GlobalBear example wrong in docstring","body":"https://github.com/coala/coala/blob/master/coalib/bearlib/abstractions/Linter.py#L780\nThe filename param doesn't exist in this scope.","comments":3,"createdAt":"2017-12-04T14:37:28Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-08T15:00:40Z","closedAt":"2018-01-08T15:00:40Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"stobis","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/23073061?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1513206664000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/4940","number":4940,"title":"linter documentation: Use single quotes for strings instead of double quotes in docstrings","body":"... where applicable to conform with our style guides.\nSometimes double quotes shall be kept, for example when there's a single quote inside them.

control","body":"Once the NextGen-Core is implemented, we have way more possibilities for different cache operating modes that shall be available as CLI arguments in coala.\n\n\n--cache-strategy / --cache-protocol:\nControls how coala manages caches for the next run.\nFollowing modes could be implemented:\n\nnone: Don't use a cache at all. A shortcut-flag could be additionally implemented, --no-cache, effectively meaning --cache-protocol=none\nprimitive: Use a cache that grows infinitely. All cache entries are stored for all following runs, and aren't removed. Effective when many recurrent changes happen in coafiles and settings. Fastest in storing.\nlri/last-recently-used\nCached items persist only until the next run.\nStretch issue: Implement count-parameters that allow to control when to discard items from the cache, e.g. after 3 runs of coala without using a cached item, discard it.\n\nMy recommendation is to use lri as default, as coala mostly is executed locally.\n\n\n--clear-cache\nClears the cache.\n\n\n--export-cache / --import-cache\nMaybe useful to share caches. Like CI server for any project run coala, and you can download the cache from there as an artifact to speed up your builds / coala runs.\n\n\n--cache-compression\nAccepts as arguments:\n\nnone: No cache compression. This is default.\nOther flags that specify common compression capabilities Python provides (for example lzma or gzip).\nCache compression should be evaluated before regarding its effectiveness, because the cache will mainly store hashes which usually aren't really redundant, the gain might be very low. The little performance penalty when loading the cache might be too much when respecting a possible very low gain of cache space reduction.\n\n\n\n--optimize-cache\nA little performance penalty to make the cache loading faster. Particularly this feature shall utilize pickletools.optimize. But this is not exclusive to this flag.","comments":10,"createdAt":"2018-02-07T19:13:16Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-21T20:54:44Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"milestone":{"title":"Nextgen-Core","createdAt":"2017-06-09T22:33:56Z","dueOn":null,"state":"open","htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/milestone/18","description":""},"labels":[{"name":"area/core","color":"eb6420"},{"name":"difficulty/medium","color":"0052cc"},{"name":"status/blocked","color":"e11d21"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1518633443000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5137","number":5137,"title":"LocalBearTestHelper: Change the docstring indentation","body":"difficulty/newcomer","comments":9,"createdAt":"2018-02-07T20:38:54Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-14T18:37:23Z","closedAt":"2018-02-14T18:37:11Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"newbazz","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25884863?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"newbazz","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25884863?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"flaredragon","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/29121452?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"status/duplicate","color":"000000"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1522433248000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5148","number":5148,"title":"Why don't we have colors in `.coafile` configuration file","body":"","comments":10,"createdAt":"2018-02-11T09:21:34Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-30T18:07:28Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"khanchi97","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22270415?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"khanchi97","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22270415?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/medium","color":"0052cc"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1520178640000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5149","number":5149,"title":"Can something be done to prevent the creation of thousands of .coverage files in my local coala repository?","body":"Why are these being created?

In the section 'Configuration Files - coafiles', the guide does not really introduce what functionality the .coafile has. It says that it is a configuration file. But what I couldn't find there is that the .coafile is something that allows you to run coala the way you want without specifying all the arguments again. Like it says in the 'about' page of the homepage, it gives one of the 2 options to run coala. I was really confused about why we need the .coafile when I was reading the guide.

One part is the handling of different output formats, like JSON, formatted or normal output. Everywhere is specific code for different operation modes of coala (showing bears vs normal execution), and this will continue to become more complicated with more features we add.\nInspired by scrapy's export feeds, we can add our own ExportFeed module. This module is responsible for accepting objects from everywhere in code (e.g. with a function export, or maybe by overriding print itself) and print them accordingly to the user.\nSent objects to the export feed may be primitive (strings, ints, floats, arbitrary objects). However, to be able to control how things shall be printed/exported for different output formats, we can support overridable methods for objects, like __json__, __formatted__ or similar.\nOne question is maybe: Why not just letting coala return the values and we just print them?\nThere's a major problem with that: For example, we want to prompt results immediately in normal execution mode (checking files) as soon as they arrive. Returning results after the execution has finished is too late. So we need a system that is capable of immediately handling objects to print/export as soon as they arrive.\nThere are still some major points left to design (what degree of interaction shall happen in the components and in the export feed? Return values of coala command for in-Python-use or only use feed export module?), but this is a basic idea on how to possibly centralize and modularize things again.\nSuggestions?

completely bypassed by apply_single=True, like all those simulated console inputs and custom actions. The whole test code can be heavily reduced. And there is also a little mistake:\nassertIn('', sio.getvalue()) can never fail. The empty string is always contained in any string. It should be assertNot(sio.getvalue()). There might be more such cases.

Like the files that shall be analyzed :) Those paths can and should always be OS-independently defined with/unix/style/forward/slashes\nBut when it comes to working interactively with coala in a Windows shell with path auto-completion, or when it comes to run coala's own tests in a Windows environment, there are windows\\style\\paths\\with\\backslashes to deal with\nBut in coala settings processing, backslashes are interpreted as escaping syntax for special characters, like in a Python string literal. So the backslashes from Windows paths just get lost. So far, this problem is solved by escaping the backslashes themselves when needed, but unfortunately using re.escape, which not only escapes backslashes but all non-alphanumeric characters\n#4883 removes most of those re.escapes since it makes them obsolete. But some of them remain and, depending on the use case, either the escaping should instead be done with coala_utils.string_processing.escape as @Makman2 suggested in #4883 (comment) or the backslashes should be turned into forward slashes like #4883 does it with cmdline arguments\nBTW: #4883 should be merged before doing this

I know my way around python so the creation and usage of a virtualenv for coala was not an issue to me, but because of the nature and complexity of the analysis tools you can use with the Bears the dependencies are a bit overwhelming for a first time user.\nSo my first suggestion: If the dependency of a bear can not be started or errors out with a known error code dump a short snippet of documentation on how to install the dep correctly. Currently it just fails with xy is not installed or something like dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, clang_annotateTokens): symbol not found. Please ensure that your python bindings are compatible with your libclang.so version. But you already have some pointers to how to fix that in http://docs.coala.io/en/latest/Users/Install.html so why not dump information conveniently (probably hidden behind the verbose switch?)\nSecondly some examples of .coafile would be much appreciated. In the getting started guide there's a relatively simple example of the generic checkers (LineLength, Spacing) which are useful but will probably only used in addition to other Bears in real world use. Some best practice examples for some common technology stacks would be incredibly useful. For example a web-app stack would need probably Python, Javascript, CSS and HTML linters and exclude the obvious folders like node_modules from the checks.\nThe documentation is perfectly valid for a seasoned developer but could probably be improved for people who are just starting out with development as the rest of the stack is probably confusing enough already.\nIs there a documentation team to contact?","comments":4,"createdAt":"2017-05-29T13:51:39Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-30T14:23:18Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"dunkelstern","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/456385?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"dunkelstern","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/456385?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"difficulty/medium","color":"0052cc"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1525560866000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/4289","number":4289,"title":"Using user wide .coarc with a `files= **/*.x` glob leads to scanning complete home directory","body":"Steps to Reproduce\n\nCreate a .coarc file in your home directory like this:\n\n[javascript]\nbears = ESLintBear\nfiles = **/*.js\nignore = node_modules/, .eslintrc.js\n\n\nChange to your project directory cd ~/Projects/js-project\nRun coala without any command line arguments\n\nActual Results\n[WARNING][18:00:22] The default coafile '.coafile' was not found.

But the general idea was born from that, that for each dependency we spawn a new task, instead of each file.\nI'm not sure how the task generation shall exactly look like, there are multiple possibilities (because self.dependency_results is a dict):\n\nPass every dependency-result to the analyze function: def analyze(self, bear, dependency_result)\nProvide every dependency result at once for each bear: def analyze(self, bear, dependency_results)\nConfigurable behaviour allowing all of these (either using new bear classes or allowing to pass some settings).\n...\n\nCurrently I'm favoring the 1st one.\nThe name of DependencyBear might change :)","comments":0,"createdAt":"2017-06-30T00:42:38Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-06T14:03:11Z","closedAt":"2017-11-06T14:03:11Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"milestone":{"title":"Nextgen-Core","createdAt":"2017-06-09T22:33:56Z","dueOn":null,"state":"open","htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/milestone/18","description":""},"labels":[{"name":"area/core","color":"eb6420"},{"name":"difficulty/medium","color":"0052cc"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1511317866000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/4428","number":4428,"title":"Add `sudo` to the installation guides","body":"When installing things on Ubuntu/Debian sudo access is required.

This task is strictly about ensuring all language setting validation results in the same error message , and that validation only occurs once per Section.","comments":9,"createdAt":"2017-07-14T02:36:34Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-27T12:18:55Z","closedAt":"2017-08-27T12:18:55Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"adhikasp","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6151302?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/aspects","color":"000000"},{"name":"area/languages","color":"d4c5f9"},{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1507129291000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/4464","number":4464,"title":"pip3 install coala-bears doesn't install coala binary","body":"No idea why.\nFound in testing with @clstaudt\nOpened by @sils","comments":3,"createdAt":"2017-07-14T13:15:29Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-04T15:01:31Z","closedAt":"2017-10-04T15:01:25Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"co-robo","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29058257?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"co-robo","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29058257?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/install","color":"bfdadc"},{"name":"type/bug","color":"e11d21"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1500469525000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/4466","number":4466,"title":"Newcomers_Guide.rst: Tell people to sign into Gitter with Github, not Twitter","body":"The Gitter section should tell people to log into Gitter with their Github account and not with Twitter, as we use the Github username for the automated stuff that corobo does.","comments":2,"createdAt":"2017-07-15T12:23:48Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-19T13:05:25Z","closedAt":"2017-07-19T13:05:25Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"NiklasMM","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1924002?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"NiklasMM","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1924002?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"palash25","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/21367710?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1500132007000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/4468","number":4468,"title":"ConfigWrite.py file is opened but not closed","body":"in line 28 self.__file = open(self.__file_name, 'w') a file is opened but never closed again.\n(taken from lgtm)\nOpened by @sims1253","comments":1,"createdAt":"2017-07-15T15:07:56Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-15T15:20:07Z","closedAt":"2017-07-15T15:20:07Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"co-robo","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29058257?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"co-robo","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29058257?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1500143535000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/4470","number":4470,"title":"DocstyleDefinition.get_available_definitions uses single ConfParser instance...","body":"... for parsing all *.coalang files, which leads to section overrides, which lead to logging.warnings, which make coala-bears CI FAIL on building docs with sphinx-build -W, like mentioned in coala/coala-bears#1819 (comment) :\nhttps://circleci.com/gh/coala/coala-bears/6570#tests/containers/1 :\nWarning, treated as error:\nparam_start setting has already been defined in section PYTHON.

Together with passing around log-printers this makes the current CLI a mess from code-perspective, that's why I think that we should implement a \"context-object\"-based approach.\ni.e.\ninstead of passing thousands of parameters around to each function that might need something (because one of the subfunctions needs something), we use a coalaRunContext. When coala gets started, we instantiate a new coalaRunContext, where we feed in stuff like passed arguments to coala, maybe sections, etc (what is taken over by the context and what not needs consideration). The context (or maybe we should call it a session object) is started by my_context.run()/my_session.run() and all methods of the CLI are going to be methods. That way there's access to all relevant information inside the context by using self.\nActually it is from designer perspective not the perfect approach in fact, I'm generally not a fan of context objects (as in our case it's in fact a singleton, singletons shouldn't be objects, and in python you can avoid them because functions are objects. That's why we ended up with our current design ;D).\nBut in this case it will help I believe. We do cross-reference so many data, so it would also speed up things and maintain readability.\nCC @satwikkansal","comments":3,"createdAt":"2017-04-16T16:35:41Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-10T13:49:45Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/CLI","color":"006b75"},{"name":"difficulty/very-high","color":"e11d21"},{"name":"status/needs design","color":"5319e7"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1500598338000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/4115","number":4115,"title":"CI: Allow testing all bears","body":"Some changes are quite complex and need to be tested against all bears.\nIdeally we have a CI mode that allows this.

BSCO aims to define a minimum section of code that needs to re checked near each modified line i.e a \"Bear dependent Section\" (BDS) with a greedy approach which on the worst case would lead to the current Caching technique , but would boost  performance in general.\"Caching.py\" file would have generic functions for some additional flags mentioned by each bear for caching to control atleast which part of the code should be re run ,so that the bear  doesn't give false flags.\nThe following are the discussed Pros and Cons if this is included in current \"Caching Method \":\n\n\n\nPros:\n*  This will lead to a huge gain in performance with bears that parse through \"sections\" running on big files.\n*  The scenario where BSCO performs best is this: \"There are tons of files and the user runs coala only after small changes to a lot of these files, but not too small that computing the benefits of BSCO is costlier than not doing it, but not too large that using BSCO (the diff calculation part) is slower than running the bear itself.\"\nCons:\n*  Sometimes ,the cost of computing the benefits of BSCO might exceed the benefits of using BSCO , which can be mentioned in Bear specific Cache flags  to avoid using it.\n*  All the current Bears would have to add additional flags , by default it will assume the current worst case.\n*  No gain in time complexity of  \"diff\" part , but realtime data should improve.","comments":4,"createdAt":"2017-02-25T07:51:43Z","updatedAt":"2017-02-27T21:25:39Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"Siddhartha1234","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/18551427?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Siddhartha1234","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/18551427?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1494023169000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/3790","number":3790,"title":"Diff: Implement new property that indicates whether actual changes exist","body":"EDIT (by @Makman2):\nIt's useful to check whether a diff has actually changes in it, and currently it can be only checked like this:\nif self.modified != self._file:\n    ...\nwhich is ugly because self._file is protected.\nA property should be introduced, Diff.has_changes or Diff.is_modified (or similar), which indicates if there are actually changes.","comments":18,"createdAt":"2017-02-26T11:36:16Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-05T22:26:09Z","closedAt":"2017-05-04T20:34:23Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"meetmangukiya","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7620533?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"meetmangukiya","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7620533?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"lshobith","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21293391?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/core","color":"eb6420"},{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"},{"name":"importance/medium","color":"fbca04"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1489576630000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/3792","number":3792,"title":"docs: Update styling to match with coala/documentation","body":"Involves replicating all the styling changes done in documentation repo to Developer docs coala/documentation@bfa74dc\nOpened via gitter by @hemangsk","comments":0,"createdAt":"2017-02-26T20:37:55Z","updatedAt":"2017-03-15T11:17:10Z","closedAt":"2017-03-15T11:17:10Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"coala-bot","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22034293?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"coala-bot","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22034293?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"hemangsk","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13018570?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"bfe5bf"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1541311820000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/3793","number":3793,"title":"Warning says to enable debug when debug is already enabled","body":"When running coala with -V , a warning message says to enable -V\nBear CheckstyleBear failed to run.

(I was unable to find any)\nFor instance, GitHub has this well known repository for .gitignore files (@github/gitignore), with one or more examples of complete and ready-to-use files for some languages. Same is true for all the \"dotfiles\" repo that some GitHub users keep.\nProposal\nSo my proposal & request is to start the same project for .coafile.  It could be named @coala/coafile-examples, or something like this.\nWhy?\nThe main reason for this list of \"ready-to-use\" examples is to increase the pace at which new coala users can indeed use coala \"in production\".\nWhen using a provided examples, it gives a ground base from where to start, instead of having to write the config file from scratch.\n(Disclaimer: I do not offer to solve it, I am basically asking this as I cannot figure how to quickly write a good .coafile for my dev workflow)","comments":11,"createdAt":"2017-01-09T08:58:49Z","updatedAt":"2017-01-11T15:58:27Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"Naereen","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11994719?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Naereen","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11994719?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/usability","color":"d4c5f9"},{"name":"importance/high","color":"eb6420"},{"name":"type/feature","color":"0052cc"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1485793054000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/3505","number":3505,"title":"Make project page great again","body":"https://github.com/coala/coala/wiki/Project-Ideas needs some nice formatting, maybe an index","comments":1,"createdAt":"2017-01-09T13:25:30Z","updatedAt":"2017-01-30T16:17:34Z","closedAt":"2017-01-30T16:12:57Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"sims1253","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6530123?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"sims1253","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6530123?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"sims1253","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6530123?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1483984254000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/3508","number":3508,"title":"Developer setup docs don't ask people to install requirements","body":"pip3 install -r requirements.txt should be inserted into the command list before each occurrence of pip3 install -e .\narea/documentation difficulty/newcomer\nOpened via gitter by @Mixih","comments":1,"createdAt":"2017-01-09T16:35:02Z","updatedAt":"2017-01-09T17:50:54Z","closedAt":"2017-01-09T17:50:54Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"coala-bot","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22034293?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"coala-bot","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22034293?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1484391864000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/3510","number":3510,"title":"OpenEditorAction : Add emacs to known editors","body":"Add emacs to KNOWN_EDITORS in OpenEditorAction.py","comments":0,"createdAt":"2017-01-09T18:52:47Z","updatedAt":"2017-01-14T11:04:24Z","closedAt":"2017-01-14T11:04:24Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"pratyushprakash","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18013053?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"pratyushprakash","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18013053?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"pratyushprakash","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18013053?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1497295699000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/3511","number":3511,"title":"`py.test` fails due to version conflict of packages","body":"Enhance py.test to first install the appropriate packages before starting the tests.\nCan prevent confusions.","comments":16,"createdAt":"2017-01-10T03:04:18Z","updatedAt":"2017-06-12T19:28:19Z","closedAt":"2017-06-12T19:28:19Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"Shade5","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13672946?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Shade5","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13672946?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"Shade5","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13672946?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1484144484000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/3512","number":3512,"title":"Add note for people to use coala-quickstart for generating their config file","body":"Still a huge problem.

have http://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Review.html\nAnd we have a 'review' requirement for joining the 'developer' team.\nWherever we put developer statistics, we should also include review actions, as they are the real meat of the core team workload.\nHowever, what we need is a meta-review system, and I believe this is sort of uncharted territory, but I am prepared to be happily surprised.\nThis will be enormously helpful for our GSoC admins (@sims1253, @sils & @jayvdb) in tracking how GSOC projects are going.\nMy concept is that we track emoji responses to review comments. 👍 and 👎 and we actively encourage the PR author to publicly acknowledge or reject review comments this way.\nAs reviewers, we all screw up sometimes, either in the substance of the review comment, or in its delivery (i.e. wrong tone).\nWe should be tracking this.  It creates a feedback loop for senior developers , letting them know when they are being too harsh, so they can self-adjust accordingly if they can see what is being said, and allows peer review among reviewers if the reviewer doesnt want to get the message.\nIf the meta-review is wrong, other people can put forward their own view on the review, which helps the PR author adjust , as they can see that their meta-reviewing is off.\nThis will cause new conflicts to be public, but they were very likely to be latent undisclosed personal conflicts anyway.\nBut .. some personal conflicts , especially between people of unequal power in a system, means one party feels they cant publicly provide feedback without fear of reprisal.\nSo the meta-review system will also need a way for people to anonymously report their disagreement with review comments.  IMO the software that collects that negative response should then also add a 👎 on the review comment using an 'anonymous' type account, which allows other meta-review processes to continue as usual (i.e. other developers to counter-act the negative meta-review by adding their own 👍).","comments":9,"createdAt":"2017-01-22T04:49:30Z","updatedAt":"2018-04-26T23:26:41Z","closedAt":"2018-04-23T18:23:34Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1486839029000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/3617","number":3617,"title":"Reorder

I have an example bear at https://github.com/maweki/coalaCheckBear-hs and a haskell framework prototype at https://github.com/maweki/coalaHs. As discussed with @sils, you guys could help out with the python/coala-side templating while I do the Haskell stuff.\nCurrently the example bear could be run with (if stack is set up) stack build && cat in.example.json | stack exec coalaCheckBear-hs. stack build can be run by coala and the files the bear registered for can be piped into stack exec coalaCheckBear-hs\nI think for this use case it is enough that the bear is self-contained.

One way to do that is for  str(SourcePosition) to be implemented.\nAfter this initial PR, we can then also enhance ConfParser and allow Setting.origin to be given as a SourceRange to identify the precise start and end of each settings.  But that is later.  (You could do that in this PR if you wanted, but only it is easy to do.

I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇  For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely. It may be more suitable to find an alternative to fill that space and act as the one-line pitch.

It's something like:-\nOrderedDict([('comment0', <Setting object(key='comment0', value='', origin='/home/theprophet/git/thepursuit/oth/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x7f5ed01aa1d0>)])\n\n\nFrom the above result I can positively say that section always maintains elements in its dictionary even when a section is empty.This is done so that the core of coala can properly identify it.\nThat's the reason, you checking if len(section.contents) == 0 will not work.Since this doesn't work your if condition fails and the message Executing Section CLI will always prompt up.\nI guess you need to change your approach.\nP.S:- Please test your changes locally before creating a PR.

I rarely used a [ cli ] section on my projects. I might be as well be wrong here 😅 . Better confirm it.\nIn any case, I guess this issue has two parts:-\n\n\nPrint Executing Section CLI only when the coala is provided with options. eg:-\ncoala --file = avenger.py --bears SpaceConsistencyBear, print the message Executing Section CLI when you execute this. But do not print it when you do the same operation using a .coafile.\nExecuting section cli gets printed even when we supply no arguments to coala.\nIf there was no [ cli ] section in the .coafile then this could be solved by a very small change in your present solution.\n\n\nCheck if there is a section named [ cli ] in the .coafile and check if its contents are empty (Do not use section.contents 😅). If so do not print the message. If it isn't empty then print it. But then again, this is a kinda broader issue.\n\n\nI mean if we are checking if the section [ cli ] is empty and then avoid printing the message Executing section cli if it is. Shouldn't we avoid printing the section beginning message  for all the sections that have no content in them in the .coafile. I don't know if that's the scope of the issue. If that is then I think it should be tackled in another issue of its own. @ishanSrt need your opinion on this.

You will\nlikely receive a lot of bot comments and build failures if coala does not\npass on every single commit!\n\nAfter you submit your pull request, DO NOT click the 'Update Branch' button.\nWhen asked for a rebase, consult coala.io/rebase\ninstead.\nPlease consider helping us by reviewing other peoples pull requests as well:\n\npick up any PR at https://coala.io/review\nreview it (check https://coala.io/reviewing for more info)\nif you are sure that it needs work, use corobo mark wip <URL> to get it out\nof the review queue.\n\nThe more you review, the more your score will grow at coala.io and we will\nreview your PRs faster!","comments":1,"createdAt":"2018-10-11T04:30:34Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-16T08:52:31Z","closedAt":"2018-10-11T05:24:21Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"Ishaan28malik","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/27343592?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Ishaan28malik","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/27343592?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"process/pending
