Build tools like Tox create temporary folders with multitude of files, and coala on every run will index them first and then filter them out. In a small project the indexing and filtering can take about 75% of the execution time (80 seconds). This should be fixed by filtering during the process of indexing.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2019-05-04T05:40:27Z","updatedAt":"2019-05-04T05:40:27Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"abraverm","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7045898?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"abraverm","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7045898?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1554878604000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/6009","number":6009,"title":"Travis CI Sentinel build failing due to new version of pytest-xdist installed","body":"Overview Description\nSteps to Reproduce\n\nClone the coala repository\nInstall test-requirements.txt\nFigure out which version of pytest-xdist is installed.
