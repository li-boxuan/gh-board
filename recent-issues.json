Just drop us a message and we'll take care of brushing\nup your stuff for merge!\nChecklist\n\n I read the commit guidelines and I've followed\nthem.\n I ran coala over my code locally. (All commits have to pass\nindividually. It is not sufficient to have \"fixup commits\" on your PR,\nour bot will still report the issues for the previous commit.) You will\nlikely receive a lot of bot comments and build failures if coala does not\npass on every single commit!\n\nAfter you submit your pull request, DO NOT click the 'Update Branch' button.\nWhen asked for a rebase, consult coala.io/rebase\ninstead.\nPlease consider helping us by reviewing other peoples pull requests as well:\n\npick up any PR at https://coala.io/review\nreview it (check https://coala.io/reviewing for more info)\nif you are sure that it needs work, use corobo mark wip <URL> to get it out\nof the review queue.\n\nThe more you review, the more your score will grow at coala.io and we will\nreview your PRs faster!","comments":2,"createdAt":"2018-10-02T19:35:02Z","updatedAt":"2018-12-29T12:59:30Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"Kartik212112","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/43776798?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Kartik212112","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/43776798?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"process/wip","color":"fbca04"},{"name":"size/XS","color":"00DE0F"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5782","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjQ4ODg2Mw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5782#issuecomment-426488863","bodyText":"The commit message is not as expected.
