I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\n\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇 For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\n\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely. It may be more suitable to find an alternative to fill that space and act as the one-line pitch. If anyone has suggestions, please feel free to add them!\n\nSome follow-up discussions can be found on that PR.

(All commits have to pass\nindividually. It is not sufficient to have \"fixup commits\" on your PR,\nour bot will still report the issues for the previous commit.) You will\nlikely receive a lot of bot comments and build failures if coala does not\npass on every single commit!\n\nAfter you submit your pull request, DO NOT click the 'Update Branch' button.\nWhen asked for a rebase, consult coala.io/rebase\ninstead.\nPlease consider helping us by reviewing other peoples pull requests as well:\n\npick up any PR at https://coala.io/review\nreview it (check https://coala.io/reviewing for more info)\nif you are sure that it needs work, use corobo mark wip <URL> to get it out\nof the review queue.\n\nThe more you review, the more your score will grow at coala.io and we will\nreview your PRs faster!","comments":4,"createdAt":"2018-12-01T00:47:35Z","updatedAt":"2018-12-05T08:40:44Z","closedAt":"2018-12-05T08:40:44Z","state":"merged","user":{"login":"Kiy4h","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/34406802?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Kiy4h","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/34406802?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"},{"name":"importance/high","color":"eb6420"},{"name":"initiatives/gci","color":"e99695"},{"name":"process/pending review","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"size/XXL","color":"AA0000"},{"name":"type/codestyle","color":"d4c5f9"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5908","comments":[{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIzODA4NDI4Mg==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5908#discussion_r238084282","bodyText":"I think I have already fixed this one.\nstop spamming please","diffHunk":"@@ -59,71 +59,68 @@ def tearDown(self):\n \n     def test_no_ipdb(self, mocked_mode_json):\n         mocked_mode_json.side_effect = None\n-        with bear_test_module(), \\\n-                prepare_file(['#fixme  '], None) as (lines, filename), \\\n-                self.pipReqIsNotInstalledMock():\n-            # additionally use RaiseTestBear to verify independency from\n-            # failing bears\n-            status, stdout, stderr = execute_coala(\n-                coala.main, 'coala', '--debug', '--json',\n-                '-c', os.devnull,\n-                '-f', filename,\n-                '-b', 'RaiseTestBear')\n-        assert status == 13\n-        assert not stdout\n-        assert '--debug flag requires ipdb.' in stderr\n+        with bear_test_module(), self.pipReqIsNotInstalledMock():\n+            with prepare_file(['#fixme  '], None) as (lines, filename):\n+                # additionally use RaiseTestBear to verify independency from\n+                # failing bears\n+                status, stdout, stderr = execute_coala(\n+                    coala.main, 'coala', '--debug', '--json',\n+                    '-c', os.devnull,\n+                    '-f', filename,\n+                    '-b', 'RaiseTestBear')\n+            assert status == 13\n+            assert not stdout\n+            assert '--debug flag requires ipdb.' in stderr\n \n     def test_bear__init__raises(self, mocked_mode_json):\n         mocked_mode_json.side_effect = None\n         mocked_ipdb = self.ipdbMock()\n-        with bear_test_module(), \\\n-                prepare_file(['#fixme  '], None) as (lines, filename), \\\n-                self.pipReqIsInstalledMock(), \\\n-                patch.dict('sys.modules', ipdb=mocked_ipdb), \\\n-                self.assertRaisesRegex(\n-                    RuntimeError,\n-                    r'^The bear ErrorTestBear does not fulfill all '\n-                    r\"requirements\\.
