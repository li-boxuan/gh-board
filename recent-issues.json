When exiting the run, the Session checks if exceptions were placed into self.silent_errors/self.recovered_errors, constructs an Exceptions instance with all of those errors and raises it in the main thread.\nAcceptance criteria:\n\nAn exception is implemented that is capable of storing multiple exceptions and emitting an appropriate error message\ncore.run() raises this exception if at least one bear or result-callback failed.
