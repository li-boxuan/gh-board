the README a kinder place by removing/replacing the John Woods quote","body":"This is migrated from #5767\nAs @joenash suggests,\nHey folks 👋\n\nThis PR is to discuss the removal of the John Woods quote from the README. I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\n\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇 For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\n\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely. It may be more suitable to find an alternative to fill that space and act as the one-line pitch. If anyone has suggestions, please feel free to add them!\n\nSome follow-up discussions can be found on that PR. This issue is opened as the pull request is not a correct place to discuss/vote.","comments":19,"createdAt":"2018-10-08T08:00:25Z","updatedAt":"2018-11-21T06:07:43Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"process/pending

Creating a Fork and Testing Your Changes\n+Step 3. Verifying the Issue Exists\n+----------------------------------\n+\n+This is an important step while taking up an issue which is often overlooked.\n+You must ensure that the issue you would like to work on exists beecause it is\n+possible that it has already been fixed as a result of a PR for a different\n+issue.\n+\n+.. important::\n+\n+    * If the issue is a bug in the source code then that shall be confirmed by\n+      executing the relevant code or files. You should also figure out how will\n+      you rectify this bug.\n+\n+    * If the issue is about some discrepancy in the documentation, then locate\n+      the region in the documentation where it exists. Find out how it can be\n+      removed.\n+\n+    * If the issue requires some additional functionality to be added, then\n+      check whether it is possible and does not conflict with the existing\n+      ones.\n+\n+    * If the issue requires the code to have some comments, then provide them\n+      in plain and easy-to-understand language.\n+\n+    * If the issue is some grammatical or spelling error either in comments or\n+      documentation, then figure out if the problem still exists and how it can\n+      be corrected.\n+\n+You must verify that the issue actually exists and work on it only if you know\n+how to fix it. While verifying the issue, you must start thinking in the\n+direction of resolving it as well. If you are able to find a fix for the\n+issue, then you can definitely claim it!\n+\n+The following should also be done to confirm the validity of the issue:\n+\n+- Check for 'closed' tag on the issue. If you can see the red-coloured 'closed'\n+  tag, then it means that the issue is closed. An issue is closed when a pull\n+  request resolving that issue is merged into the repository's default branch.\n+- Check if an open pull request exists or not. If it exists, then you may look\n+  for some other issue because an active PR means that someone else is working\n+  on that issue and that person's work is yet to be reviewed. You may also note\n+  that even if there is an open pull request, sometimes people can still claim\n+  the issue.\n+  e.g. the open pull request has been stale for months. Then it is very likely\n+  the previous developer either forgot about it or gave up. In this case, you\n+  need to claim that you would like to do the issue and also ask for help on\n+  our gitter channel.\n+- You can also type the issue number in the search bar appearing on the\n+  issues page. If the issue exists then it will appear in the search results.\n+  Also ensure that it is not assigned to anyone by checking the 'Assignee'\n+  column.\n+- Newcomers cannot work on issues having label ``initiatives/gci`` as they are","author":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4","name":"Keshav Garg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-11-10T14:45:27Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-10T14:45:27Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODI5NDgwMQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5866#issuecomment-438294801","bodyText":"@jayvdb can you please elaborate regarding what should i rewrite?","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"AditiKatiyar","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/29947483?v=4","name":null},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:56:13Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-13T14:56:13Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1541563933000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5867","number":5867,"title":"coalaTest: Add test preventing unknown warnings","body":"Currently the test_coala_with_color and _without_color\ntests fail with little indication of what is happening,\nespecially as the first warnings messages are related to\nthe .coafile 'Default' section.

Even if your .coafile is something like below where your [cli] section is not present. It would help you to know that the [ cli ] section is generated automatically by Cliparser.py when you supply the arguments to coala. This section gets saved to your .coafile when you supply --save option.\n[python]\nfiles = admin.py\nbears = SpaceConsistencyBear, QuotesBear\nlanguage = Python\npreferred_quotation = '\n\ndefault_actions = **: ApplyPatchAction\n\nWhen i tried to debug it, section.contents always returns a Ordered dict of length 1 when the contents in the [ cli ] section is empty. I tried to print the value of section.contents when the [ cli ] section is empty. It's something like:-\nOrderedDict([('comment0', <Setting object(key='comment0', value='', origin='/home/theprophet/git/thepursuit/oth/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x7f5ed01aa1d0>)])\n\n\nFrom the above result I can positively say that section always maintains elements in its dictionary even when a section is empty.This is done so that the core of coala can properly identify it.\nThat's the reason, you checking if len(section.contents) == 0 will not work.Since this doesn't work your if condition fails and the message Executing Section CLI will always prompt up.\nI guess you need to change your approach.\nP.S:- Please test your changes locally before creating a PR.

I rarely used a [ cli ] section on my projects. I might be as well be wrong here 😅 . Better confirm it.\nIn any case, I guess this issue has two parts:-\n\n\nPrint Executing Section CLI only when the coala is provided with options. eg:-\ncoala --file = avenger.py --bears SpaceConsistencyBear, print the message Executing Section CLI when you execute this. But do not print it when you do the same operation using a .coafile.\nExecuting section cli gets printed even when we supply no arguments to coala.\nIf there was no [ cli ] section in the .coafile then this could be solved by a very small change in your present solution.\n\n\nCheck if there is a section named [ cli ] in the .coafile and check if its contents are empty (Do not use section.contents 😅). If so do not print the message. If it isn't empty then print it. But then again, this is a kinda broader issue.\n\n\nI mean if we are checking if the section [ cli ] is empty and then avoid printing the message Executing section cli if it is. Shouldn't we avoid printing the section beginning message  for all the sections that have no content in them in the .coafile. I don't know if that's the scope of the issue.
