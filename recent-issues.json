Can you please take of this from next time? It's good that you're reviewing the merge requests and coala appreciate your review-work, but coala warns users who create merge requests for first time without getting assigned on that issue. If the user still not takes that warning seriously, then we have to take a strict action against him.\nSince @hiteshsubnani0128 is a first-time contributor, so we (or you) should give a warning that to not to create a PR w/o getting assigned on issue. And, since you've created it its' ok and please take care to not to create a PR until assigned on the issue. And, mostly first-time contributors don't have an idea about commit guidelines so we should address them to follow it.\nAnd, its contributor duty also to read commit guidelines if not read before. Because whenever user is about to create a PR, the coala pre-defined commit message appears in which two tasks are to be completed by contributor - follow guidelines and to run coala on new changes.\nSo, try to give a warning to first-time contributors in a polite manner w/o asking them to close the PR.
