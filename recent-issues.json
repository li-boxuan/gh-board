the README a kinder place by removing/replacing the John Woods quote","body":"This is migrated from #5767\nAs @joenash suggests,\nHey folks 👋\n\nThis PR is to discuss the removal of the John Woods quote from the README. I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\n\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇 For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\n\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely.

The override methods mostly just call the super() method, creating an extra performance degradation.\nThe only method which isnt just super() is __getitem__.  It contains a bug, because if the value in the dict has 0 lines, val is [] , and if val: will be false, and None is returned instead of [].  That is wildly different behaviour to previously, as None is not iterable.  It means all code (including global bears) needs to check whether the file is None before iterating over the file contents.  File contents being None was previously possible, but only when 'raw' mode was enabled.  A file with 0 lines is not the same as an unreadable / raw file.\nFileFactory was introduced in b06dfe4.  The most critical problem is that it is not a \"factory\".  Factories are an extremely important and very well established pattern covered in all OO books with buying ( https://www.oodesign.com/factory-pattern.html ), so to call this a factory is very confusing / misleading.\nIt was to be a wrapper for a \"file\" object, which was previously a list of str, where each item was a line of the file.  While a design goal was to hide some of the details, it still needs to be backwards compatible in order to avoid breaking existing code.  This is especially important at the moment given that the current status of coala is so bug ridden with many regressions that investigating bugs requires installing from old git commits more than a year to verify the old behaviour.\nTwo \"list\" unimplemented methods which were used by coala-quickstart are __len__ and __getitem__.  These missing methods need to be re-implemented.  If there is a good justification for deprecating them, that deprecation should be done properly.  For __len__, it seems unjustifiable to not provide this, as this single number can be cached and provides a lot of information, and is especially helpful if avoiding re-reading files which have been evicted from the cache, as a 0 line file can be more efficiently created in memory than re-reading from the disk.  __getitem__ is much easier to justify deprecating if the file contents are being evicted from the cache to reduce the memory footprint of coala.  That hasnt been implemented yet.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-10-13T18:57:47Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-17T11:22:38Z","closedAt":"2018-10-17T11:22:38Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1541054794000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5812","number":5812,"title":"LocalBearTestHelper:

This is true for Windows, MacOS and Linux(Arch Linux, Ubuntu and Linux Mint are tested upon) and is evident from their documentation on Windows and macOS\n\nThere is an internal command too, to set the path variable specifiaclly to code as can be seen from this gif:\n\nGuidance Required:\n\nThere exists a way to open a file to a particular line and position in VSCode but doesn't follow the scheme like the rest of the editors. In order to open a file to a particular location, the command goes:\n$code <file_name>:{line}:{column} -g. Here the -g is mandatory. If -g is failed to be specified, a new file with peculiar extension is opened.\nFor Ex: .j:8:9 would be the extension of the file.\nThis is even specified in their docs found here\nSo the question arises should the -g be put as an args or should it be included in the file opening scheme itself.\n\nDesription of args parameters:\n\n-g - Goto a specific line\n-n - Open new window\nr - Reuse current window\n--wait - Wait for the file to be closed before returning.\n\nAny changes required will be implemented as soon as possible.\n\nFor short term contributors: we understand that getting your commits well\ndefined like we require is a hard task and takes some learning.

One way to do that is for  str(SourcePosition) to be implemented.\nAfter this initial PR, we can then also enhance ConfParser and allow Setting.origin to be given as a SourceRange to identify the precise start and end of each settings.  But that is later.  (You could do that in this PR if you wanted, but only it is easy to do.  Otherwise it is better to do this in stages.)\nThen the real fun begins when we consider section inheritance and +=, and even more funky when we consider #5532 .  To model that correctly we would need a new class for \"MultipleRanges\", which would probably become a superclass for the Diff class which we do have.","diffHunk":"@@ -160,7 +160,8 @@ def __init__(self,\n                  list_delimiters: Iterable = (',', ';'),\n                  from_cli: bool = False,\n                  remove_empty_iter_elements: bool = True,\n-                 to_append: bool = False):\n+                 to_append: bool = False,\n+                 line_number: int = 0):","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"createdAt":"2018-10-14T00:43:02Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-10-14T00:43:02Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIyNDk3NTgyNw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5811#discussion_r224975827","bodyText":"This should be _get_lines , as it is not a method which should be used outside of coalib/settings , and it will likely be revised/discarded in future rewrites.","diffHunk":"@@ -250,6 +250,26 @@ def __str__(self):\n                                for key in self.contents)\n         return self.name + ' {' + value_list + '}'\n \n+    def get_lines(self, key):","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"createdAt":"2018-10-14T00:47:50Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-10-14T00:47:50Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIyNDk3NTg5NQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5811#discussion_r224975895","bodyText":"The first part of an exception message should be the summary of the exception.\nIf you want to add the .coafile lines to the message , they go after the summary.\nThey are debugging info.\nWhile it is a good addition to add the 'lines' here, what would be more helpful to the reader would be the Setting.value .\nBut that also comes with its own problems, because a Setting is a StringConverter which is a rather complicated beast - dragons be there.","diffHunk":"@@ -140,10 +140,13 @@ def return_arg(x):\n         if annotation is None:\n             annotation = return_arg\n \n+        lines = section.get_lines(param)\n         try:\n             return annotation(section[param])\n         except (TypeError, ValueError):\n-            raise ValueError('Unable to convert parameter {!r} into type '\n+            raise ValueError('\\n.coafile lines: ' +\n+                             str(lines) +","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"createdAt":"2018-10-14T00:52:33Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-10-14T00:52:33Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIyNTA3MjM0Nw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5811#discussion_r225072347","bodyText":"@jayvdb  Why do we need to convert to Setting.origin to string?

Even if your .coafile is something like below where your [cli] section is not present.

I tried to print the value of section.contents when the [ cli ] section is empty. It's something like:-\nOrderedDict([('comment0', <Setting object(key='comment0', value='', origin='/home/theprophet/git/thepursuit/oth/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x7f5ed01aa1d0>)])\n\n\nFrom the above result I can positively say that section always maintains elements in its dictionary even when a section is empty.This is done so that the core of coala can properly identify it.\nThat's the reason, you checking if len(section.contents) == 0 will not work.Since this doesn't work your if condition fails and the message Executing Section CLI will always prompt up.\nI guess you need to change your approach.\nP.S:- Please test your changes locally before creating a PR.

But do not print it when you do the same operation using a .coafile.\nExecuting section cli gets printed even when we supply no arguments to coala.\nIf there was no [ cli ] section in the .coafile then this could be solved by a very small change in your present solution.\n\n\nCheck if there is a section named [ cli ] in the .coafile and check if its contents are empty (Do not use section.contents 😅). If so do not print the message. If it isn't empty then print it. But then again, this is a kinda broader issue.\n\n\nI mean if we are checking if the section [ cli ] is empty and then avoid printing the message Executing section cli if it is. Shouldn't we avoid printing the section beginning message  for all the sections that have no content in them in the .coafile. I don't know if that's the scope of the issue.
