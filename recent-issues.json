and FileProxy fixes","body":"fbe8452 introduced FileDict, as a subclass of dict.\nIt contains many unnecessary methods which needlessly override the dict method.  The override methods mostly just call the super() method, creating an extra performance degradation.\nThe only method which isnt just super() is __getitem__.  It contains a bug, because if the value in the dict has 0 lines, val is [] , and if val: will be false, and None is returned instead of [].  That is wildly different behaviour to previously, as None is not iterable.  It means all code (including global bears) needs to check whether the file is None before iterating over the file contents.  File contents being None was previously possible, but only when 'raw' mode was enabled.  A file with 0 lines is not the same as an unreadable / raw file.\nFileFactory was introduced in b06dfe4.  The most critical problem is that it is not a \"factory\".  Factories are an extremely important and very well established pattern covered in all OO books with buying ( https://www.oodesign.com/factory-pattern.html ), so to call this a factory is very confusing / misleading.\nIt was to be a wrapper for a \"file\" object, which was previously a list of str, where each item was a line of the file.  While a design goal was to hide some of the details, it still needs to be backwards compatible in order to avoid breaking existing code.  This is especially important at the moment given that the current status of coala is so bug ridden with many regressions that investigating bugs requires installing from old git commits more than a year to verify the old behaviour.\nTwo \"list\" unimplemented methods which were used by coala-quickstart are __len__ and __getitem__.  These missing methods need to be re-implemented.  If there is a good justification for deprecating them, that deprecation should be done properly.  For __len__, it seems unjustifiable to not provide this, as this single number can be cached and provides a lot of information, and is especially helpful if avoiding re-reading files which have been evicted from the cache, as a 0 line file can be more efficiently created in memory than re-reading from the disk.  __getitem__ is much easier to justify deprecating if the file contents are being evicted from the cache to reduce the memory footprint of coala.  That hasnt been implemented yet.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-10-13T18:57:47Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-17T11:22:38Z","closedAt":"2018-10-17T11:22:38Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1539667079000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5812","number":5812,"title":"LocalBearTestHelper: Proper deprecation for timeout","body":"#5723 was an over-hasty way of removing the dependency on pytest.\nThe assert not timeout broke one of the bears which used the timeout.\nThe bear was updated to remove the unnecessary timeout, but the assert will break old versions of coala-bears being used with the current coalib, which needlessly complicates setting up an environment to investigate old bugs.\nIt should be properly deprecated with a warning that the timeout is ignored.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2018-10-13T19:22:33Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-16T05:17:59Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"},{"name":"importance/medium","color":"fbca04"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1539484602000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5740","number":5740,"title":"Add language for SASS","body":"Like coalib/bearlib/languages/definitions/CSS.py","comments":4,"createdAt":"2018-08-30T03:45:30Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-14T02:36:42Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"Utkarsh1308","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/23418707?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"},{"name":"importance/medium","color":"fbca04"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1539418066000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5745","number":5745,"title":"Imported classes should be arranged lexicographically","body":"Classes being imported in coala/coalib/bearlib/languages/__init__.py file should be arranged alphabetically.\nA good newcomer issue.","comments":10,"createdAt":"2018-09-01T23:10:26Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-13T08:07:46Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"shashwatmishra76","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/24711156?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"shashwatmishra76","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/24711156?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"subhaminion","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13986359?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1537420819000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5749","number":5749,"title":"Tests Failing for Python3.4 only on Circle CI","body":"Refer Circle CI Tests for Python3.4 on  #5747  and #5727\nThe Tests are Failing on:\n_______________________ coalaTest.test_coala_with_color ________________________\n\nself = <tests.coalaTest.coalaTest testMethod=test_coala_with_color>\n\n    def test_coala_with_color(self):\n        with bear_test_module(), \\\n                prepare_file(['#fixme'], None) as (lines, filename):\n            retval, stdout, stderr = execute_coala(\n                coala.main, 'coala')\n            errors = filter(bool, stderr.split('\\n'))\n            #

I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\n\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇 For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\n\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely. It may be more suitable to find an alternative to fill that space and act as the one-line pitch. If anyone has suggestions, please feel free to add them!\n\nSome follow-up discussions can be found on that PR.

One way to do that is for  str(SourcePosition) to be implemented.\nAfter this initial PR, we can then also enhance ConfParser and allow Setting.origin to be given as a SourceRange to identify the precise start and end of each settings.  But that is later.  (You could do that in this PR if you wanted, but only it is easy to do.  Otherwise it is better to do this in stages.)\nThen the real fun begins when we consider section inheritance and +=, and even more funky when we consider #5532 .

I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇  For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely. It may be more suitable to find an alternative to fill that space and act as the one-line pitch.

This section gets saved to your .coafile when you supply --save option.\n[python]\nfiles = admin.py\nbears = SpaceConsistencyBear, QuotesBear\nlanguage = Python\npreferred_quotation = '\n\ndefault_actions = **: ApplyPatchAction\n\nWhen i tried to debug it, section.contents always returns a Ordered dict of length 1 when the contents in the [ cli ] section is empty. I tried to print the value of section.contents when the [ cli ] section is empty. It's something like:-\nOrderedDict([('comment0', <Setting object(key='comment0', value='', origin='/home/theprophet/git/thepursuit/oth/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x7f5ed01aa1d0>)])\n\n\nFrom the above result I can positively say that section always maintains elements in its dictionary even when a section is empty.This is done so that the core of coala can properly identify it.\nThat's the reason, you checking if len(section.contents) == 0 will not work.Since this doesn't work your if condition fails and the message Executing Section CLI will always prompt up.\nI guess you need to change your approach.\nP.S:- Please test your changes locally before creating a PR. This will save yours and the reviewers time :)","diffHunk":"@@ -183,7 +183,8 @@ def run_coala(console_printer=None,\n                 section['default_actions'] = '*: ShowPatchAction'\n                 section['show_result_on_top'] = 'yeah'\n \n-            print_section_beginning(section)\n+            if not (section.name == 'cli' and len(section.contents) == 0):","author":{"login":"Naveenaidu","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30195193?v=4","name":"Naveen Naidu"},"createdAt":"2018-09-29T01:47:38Z","lastEditedAt":"2018-09-29T03:18:23Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-29T03:18:23Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIyMTQxMjU1OA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5770#discussion_r221412558","bodyText":"IMO you are editing the wrong file.\nI don't think we usually have a [ cli ] section in our .coafile. I rarely used a [ cli ] section on my projects. I might be as well be wrong here 😅 . Better confirm it.\nIn any case, I guess this issue has two parts:-\n\n\nPrint Executing Section CLI only when the coala is provided with options. eg:-\ncoala --file = avenger.py --bears SpaceConsistencyBear, print the message Executing Section CLI when you execute this. But do not print it when you do the same operation using a .coafile.\nExecuting section cli gets printed even when we supply no arguments to coala.\nIf there was no [ cli ] section in the .coafile then this could be solved by a very small change in your present solution.\n\n\nCheck if there is a section named [ cli ] in the .coafile and check if its contents are empty (Do not use section.contents 😅). If so do not print the message. If it isn't empty then print it. But then again, this is a kinda broader issue.\n\n\nI mean if we are checking if the section[ cli ] is empty and then avoid printing the message Executing section cli if it is. Shouldn't we avoid printing the section beginning message  for all the sections that have no content in them in the .coafile. I don't know if that's the scope of the issue. If that is then I think it should be tackled in another issue of its own. @ishanSrt need your opinion on this.
