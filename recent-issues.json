I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇  For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely. It may be more suitable to find an alternative to fill that space and act as the one-line pitch.

Even if your .coafile is something like below where your [cli] section is not present. It would help you to know that the [ cli ] section is generated automatically by Cliparser.py when you supply the arguments to coala. This section gets saved to your .coafile when you supply --save option.\n[python]\nfiles = admin.py\nbears = SpaceConsistencyBear, QuotesBear\nlanguage = Python\npreferred_quotation = '\n\ndefault_actions = **: ApplyPatchAction\n\nWhen i tried to debug it, section.contents always returns a Ordered dict of length 1 when the contents in the [ cli ] section is empty. I tried to print the value of section.contents when the [ cli ] section is empty. It's something like:-\nOrderedDict([('comment0', <Setting object(key='comment0', value='', origin='/home/theprophet/git/thepursuit/oth/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x7f5ed01aa1d0>)])\n\n\nFrom the above result I can positively say that section always maintains elements in its dictionary even when a section is empty.This is done so that the core of coala can properly identify it.\nThat's the reason, you checking if len(section.contents) == 0 will not work.Since this doesn't work your if condition fails and the message Executing Section CLI will always prompt up.\nI guess you need to change your approach.\nP.S:- Please test your changes locally before creating a PR.

I rarely used a [ cli ] section on my projects. I might be as well be wrong here 😅 . Better confirm it.\nIn any case, I guess this issue has two parts:-\n\n\nPrint Executing Section CLI only when the coala is provided with options. eg:-\ncoala --file = avenger.py --bears SpaceConsistencyBear, print the message Executing Section CLI when you execute this. But do not print it when you do the same operation using a .coafile.\nExecuting section cli gets printed even when we supply no arguments to coala.\nIf there was no [ cli ] section in the .coafile then this could be solved by a very small change in your present solution.\n\n\nCheck if there is a section named [ cli ] in the .coafile and check if its contents are empty (Do not use section.contents 😅). If so do not print the message. If it isn't empty then print it. But then again, this is a kinda broader issue.\n\n\nI mean if we are checking if the section[ cli ] is empty and then avoid printing the message Executing section cli if it is. Shouldn't we avoid printing the section beginning message  for all the sections that have no content in them in the .coafile. I don't know if that's the scope of the issue.

Your shortlog, and your commit message do not correspond to the format specified.\nChecklist specifically tells you to go through the commit guidelines, but you seem to have skipped that part altogether.\nYou're commit message should be something like this:\nReview.rst: Typo Github->GitHub\nCloses #5512\nThis format makes sure, that the issue is closed automatically when the pull request is merged. Filename is important because when you see your repository, it displays you're last commit in that directory, and it's much easier to know where the change was made when the filename is specified in the commit shortlog.\nPlease update your PR, and DO NOT FORGET TO SQUASH YOU'RE COMMITS into one.
