We can improve the way it is managed by improving moban.\nYour point '3' is the only significant problem, and that can be solved by moban having patch support, so we can exclude the other code e.g. moremoban/moban#75 . A header can also be added using a patch.\nI am not worried about the licensing being missing from the file, as anyone modifying this file will likely be informed via code review, or will be reverted when someone looks at the moban job.  We should distribute the MIT license, and any other license of code we're including, but by no means is this \"substantial portions\" according to the MIT license so we're not breaking the license by not including it.  And by having a control file which mentions where code came from, and thus were the license text can be found, we're not hiding the fact the code is copied.\nThe fact it is unmaintained is a problem for the future, as PRs upstream will not get merged.  Again, a .patch could solve that, but i would expect that this type of code would be moved to a new coala-compat package, or something like that, or a sub-module of coala-utils.\nSame with the .coafile problems.  A patch can fix it.\nThe drawbacks of not doing it:\n\nanother piece of copied code will fade into the coala codebase and its history effectively lost\ncoala doesnt have a process for allowing externally written code into the repo.\nmoban doesnt have a user (coala) pushing for it to handle more complicated scenarios than just 'copy'.\ncoala doesnt start the process of identifying and fixing any existing copied code.  This one is MIT, but we will likely find some which isnt so freely licensed.  e.g. we have CC-BY-SA-licensed 'code' in some repos, and a major issue over in coala-quickstart\netc.\n\nBeing in .moban.yaml is an annoyance.
