Raise exception in core.run() when bear or result-callback raised an exception","body":"Currently the core properly cleans up the failing bear and discards all dependent tasks and bears, and then swallows the exception.\nHowever, coala (and other users) needs to know that something didn't work perfectly, for example returning an error code that some analysis was run, but couldn't complete due to errors.\nI propose to write a custom exception that aggregates all those swallowed exceptions and is then raised in core.run().\nclass Exceptions(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, exceptions):\n        super().__init__('Multiple exceptions happened:\\n' + '\\n\\n'.join(str(ex) for ex in exceptions)\n        self.exceptions = exceptions\nTo make use of it, the core Session has another field, e.g. self.silent_errors or self.recovered_errors (or similar), where all components can put in their errors if they can recover from them. When exiting the run, the Session checks if exceptions were placed into self.silent_errors/self.recovered_errors, constructs an Exceptions instance with all of those errors and raises it in the main thread.\nAcceptance criteria:\n\nAn exception is implemented that is capable of storing multiple exceptions and emitting an appropriate error message\ncore.run() raises this exception if at least one bear or result-callback failed.
