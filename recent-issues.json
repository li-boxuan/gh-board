Just drop us a message and we'll take care of brushing\nup your stuff for merge!\nChecklist\n\n I read the commit guidelines and I've followed\nthem.\n I ran coala over my code locally. (All commits have to pass\nindividually. It is not sufficient to have \"fixup commits\" on your PR,\nour bot will still report the issues for the previous commit.) You will\nlikely receive a lot of bot comments and build failures if coala does not\npass on every single commit!\n\nAfter you submit your pull request, DO NOT click the 'Update Branch' button.\nWhen asked for a rebase, consult coala.io/rebase\ninstead.\nPlease consider helping us by reviewing other peoples pull requests as well:\n\npick up any PR at https://coala.io/review\nreview it (check https://coala.io/reviewing for more info)\nif you are sure that it needs work, use corobo mark wip <URL> to get it out\nof the review queue.\n\nThe more you review, the more your score will grow at coala.io and we will\nreview your PRs faster!","comments":5,"createdAt":"2019-01-08T07:27:44Z","updatedAt":"2019-02-16T11:51:50Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"PrajwalM2212","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30733262?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"PrajwalM2212","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30733262?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"PrajwalM2212","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30733262?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"process/pending review","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"size/XS","color":"00DE0F"},{"name":"type/bug","color":"e11d21"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5938","comments":[{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDI1MjE3NjQxMA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5938#discussion_r252176410","bodyText":"can you look for a way to have load_configuration return the old tuple return type, and create a new function to return the new improved return type.\nOtherwise load_configuration is broken in all existing uses of it, and most coala tools use it, and expect a tuple returned.","diffHunk":"@@ -293,6 +301,23 @@ def load_configuration(arg_list,\n \n         sections = merge_section_dicts(sections, cli_sections)\n \n+    remove_default_section(sections)\n+\n+    remove_default_section(to_save_sections)\n+\n+    str_log_level = str(sections['cli'].get('log_level', '')).upper()\n+    logging.getLogger().setLevel(LOG_LEVEL.str_dict.get(str_log_level,\n+                                                        LOG_LEVEL.INFO))\n+\n+    return to_save_sections, sections, targets","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"createdAt":"2019-01-30T09:32:52Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-01-30T09:32:52Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjM0MDMzMw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5938#issuecomment-452340333","bodyText":"Travis is failing for a reason not related to my changes","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"PrajwalM2212","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30733262?v=4","name":"PRAJWAL M"},"createdAt":"2019-01-08T15:31:40Z","lastEditedAt":"2019-01-09T02:12:02Z","updatedAt":"2019-01-09T02:12:02Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTk1NTA1OQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5938#issuecomment-455955059","bodyText":"@PrajwalM2212 Please add some unit tests to ensure that correct behaviour is observed.\nTest file: tests/settings/ConfigurationGatheringTest.py\nDocs: Writing Tests\nEdit: Didn't look close enough, tests have already been added.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"iamkroot","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/29517049?v=4","name":"Krut Patel"},"createdAt":"2019-01-21T05:46:30Z","lastEditedAt":"2019-01-21T06:10:21Z","updatedAt":"2019-01-21T06:10:21Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTk1ODc0Mg==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5938#issuecomment-455958742","bodyText":"@PrajwalM2212 Yup, I'm sorry for that, didn't scroll down far enough.
