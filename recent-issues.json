The summary line may be used by automatic indexing tools; it is important that it fits on one line and is separated from the rest of the docstring by a blank line. The summary line may be on the same line as the opening quotes or on the next line. The entire docstring is indented the same as the quotes at its first line (see example below).\nThe docstring for a module should generally list the classes, exceptions and functions (and any other objects) that are exported by the module, with a one-line summary of each. (These summaries generally give less detail than the summary line in the object's docstring.)","comments":3,"createdAt":"2018-06-17T07:40:12Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-14T09:14:29Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/aspects","color":"000000"},{"name":"area/documentation","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"process/wip","color":"fbca04"},{"name":"size/XS","color":"00DE0F"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5538","comments":[{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDE5NTkyNDk2Nw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5538#discussion_r195924967","bodyText":"It must be prose.

(All commits have to pass\nindividually. It is not sufficient to have \"fixup commits\" on your PR,\nour bot will still report the issues for the previous commit.) You will\nlikely receive a lot of bot comments and build failures if coala does not\npass on every single commit!\n\nAfter you submit your pull request, DO NOT click the 'Update Branch' button.\nWhen asked for a rebase, consult coala.io/rebase\ninstead.\nPlease consider helping us by reviewing other peoples pull requests as well:\n\npick up any PR at https://coala.io/review\nreview it (check https://coala.io/reviewing for more info)\nif you are sure that it needs work, use corobo mark wip <URL> to get it out\nof the review queue.\n\nThe more you review, the more your score will grow at coala.io and we will\nreview your PRs faster!","comments":11,"createdAt":"2018-07-01T21:40:05Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-31T11:16:43Z","closedAt":"2018-08-31T09:34:03Z","state":"merged","user":{"login":"palash25","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/21367710?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"palash25","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/21367710?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"palash25","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/21367710?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/core","color":"eb6420"},{"name":"area/documentation","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"process/pending review","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"size/XS","color":"00DE0F"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5585","comments":[{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwMzk1MTY5OA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5585#discussion_r203951698","bodyText":"Run pydocstyle on this.

The old bears expect that currently.\n\nIs there a part of the codebase where we can make changes so that all the bears receive only the file contents and not the objects so that we don't have to change the bears implementation individually, you know like a middleware between the collection of objects and the actual analysis?\n\nYeah inside Processing.py. Instead of giving bears the file factory objects, give them file_factory.lines. I know we currently loose the lazy-loading capability with that, but that's easiest for now.\nIf you want to keep the lazy loading capabilities, we could write (like you suggested) some kind of \"middleware\", meaning we have a proxy dict object that gives access to file contents that works the same way as before for bears, but calls the right functions of FileFactory in the background.\nLike:\nclass FileDict:  # mimics dict\n    def __getitem__(self, filename):\n        return self._my_file_middlewares[filename]\n    #...\n\nclass FileMiddleware:\n    def __getitem__(self, lineindex):\n        return self._underlying_file_proxy.lines[lineindex]\n    #...","diffHunk":"@@ -13,6 +13,6 @@ def run(self, filename, file):\n         \"\"\"\n         yield Result.from_values(\n             origin=self,\n-            message='This file has {count} lines.'.format(count=len(file)),\n+            message='This file has {count} lines.'.format(count=len(file.lines)),","author":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4","name":"Mischa Krüger"},"createdAt":"2018-07-20T16:54:36Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-07-20T16:54:36Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwNDEyNTkyMw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5627#discussion_r204125923","bodyText":"fine with me 👍","diffHunk":"@@ -267,16 +268,17 @@ def get_file_dict(filename_list, log_printer=None, allow_raw_files=False):\n     :return:                Reads the content of each file into a dictionary\n                             with filenames as keys.\n     \"\"\"\n-    file_dict = {}\n+    file_set = {}","author":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4","name":"Mischa Krüger"},"createdAt":"2018-07-20T18:05:27Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-07-20T18:05:27Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwNDEyNjI3OA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5627#discussion_r204126278","bodyText":"Its to invoke FileFactory.string in case of raw files to raise a UnicodeDecode error so that we can move into the except clause that handles the raw files.

little bit of explanation: the Green Mode Project requires to differentiate between settings which can attain a specific set of values. A type of these setting which can have some discrete set of values is tackled in the PR.\nMost of the additions are self explanatory except for the variable CALL_FROM_QUICKSTART. The Green Mode project requires the valid values of these settings so that it can run coala over and over again by giving the bears all these values. Since we are also adding value checks in this PR, the field ACCEPTABLE_VALUES_FOR_SETTINGS won't get populated until the call to run method is made which contradicts the fact that we still don't have the acceptable values. The introduced variable uses the fact that even an incomplete call to the decorator populates the variable and thus saves execution time and running into errors.\nAlternate approach could have been the bear writer populating a field else where and calling the decorator with those fields that quickstart can utilise directly but it just felt inelegant and contradicting the process of making bear development easier and easier by making changes at two different places to achieve a single task.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4","name":"Ishan Srivastava"},"createdAt":"2018-06-13T23:53:55Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-06-13T23:53:55Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Nzk1MjAyMw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5523#issuecomment-397952023","bodyText":"An interesting solution, but argument type annotations are the way that the Settings module works.

If it doesnt work with only minor implementation issues, I will implement it myself as a demo.\nIf I cant get it to work, we may revisit this decorator approach.\nNote also that this decorator would not be usable in coala-bears repo until we do a release of coala, and that is a huge risk to take for any project, especially given that I uncovered that there are ~20 bears tests broken when using coala master (and @sangamcse has reproduced it, and was going to investigate further; https://gitter.im/coala/coala?at=5b274d604755974910317329), so that is another task someone needs to do before we
